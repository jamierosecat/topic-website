        <h2>Timothy A. Pearce</h2>
<p class="p2">Tim Pearce is the curater of mollusks at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. 
    He has a youtube channel and a tiktok page full of informational facts and jokes about snails. I admire his enthusiasm and his unbridled passion
and joy for his field of study. I would like to work in a museum and curate a collection of my own someday.</p>

        <h2>Stephen Hillenburg</h2>
<p class="p2">Stephen Hillenburg was a marine biologist and one of the most influental cartoon creators to this day.
        His work as both a biologist and a cartoonist is inspiring to me, and I hope to one day make a show about bugs that is just as witty and silly as Spongebob Squarepants.
        Stephen's background in marine biology is evident in the environments and designs in the show, and brought a lot of light and attention to creatures without
        a lot of previous representation in pop culture. <br>
